# ChatApplication
a chat application that enables text messaging
 between a server and a client.
 
 Instructions
1. Load up my files on a python IDE to run.
2. Run the server first it should give you errors if you input wrong ip or port
number bigger than 2^15-1.
3. On the client side to get the chat application working it has to be the
same ip and port number as the server side.
4. It will work once you have the same ip and port number but you can
only send message one by one as in if you type a message on client
first you have to wait for a response from the server.
5. If you want to end the chat where it says “Enter message” just type in
end then its gonna end the chat and a prompt should pop up saying it
ended
6. For error handling on the server side you can type a wrong ip address
format then a prompt should pop up , then also for the port number any
number bigger than 2^15-1 should pop up a error message
7. For error handling on the client side, if ip doesnt match from the server
side a message should pop up, also if the port number doesnt match
from the server side an error message should pop up.
